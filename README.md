# Enter the Dungeon: A cooperative or solo way to play magic with your cards

## [DEMO](https://vivianeasley.github.io/enter-the-dungeon/)

This is a way to play Magic the Gathering solo or cooperatively with your friends using the dungeon mechanic. This is very hastely put together so don't expect much. There is a known bug where click on a room sometimes takes multiple clicks. What are you going to do ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è.


If people are interested I in actually using this I can spruce it up and add mechanics, settings, more encounters, etc.
